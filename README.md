# DSA Practice & LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) practice problems, primarily sourced from LeetCode and Yandex contests. The solutions are implemented in Python (with some C++), and are organized by topic and month for easy navigation and review.

## Structure

- **leetcode/**
  - **March/**: Some of the problems solved in March, grouped by naem (e.g., Anagram, ArrProduct, Encode, EvenFreq, GroupAnagram, LetterTwice, LongestPrefix, Majority, MinMaxFrq, PalindromeNum, RomanToInt, TwoSum).
  - **April/**: Some of the problems solved in April, grouped by name (e.g., maxConSeq, maxTriplet, mergeSrts, minStack, missingDouble, missingNumber, removeDuplicates, removeNthNode, reorerLL, reverseLL, reverseString, rotateString, searchInsert, simpleRotate, squaresSorted, stringRevInplace, stringTOInt, validParenthesis, wordPatterns, zeroMovement).
- **yandex-algos/**
  - **I_Greedy/**: Solutions to Yandex algorithm contest problems (e.g., A_Classrooms, B_NoMore_NoLess, C_Internet, D_Knapsack_Gold). 

## Highlights

- **LeetCode Problems**: Each folder contains one or more Python scripts solving a specific problem, often with multiple approaches (brute force, optimized, etc.).
- **Yandex Contest Problems**: Efficient (or are they? VSauce sound...) solutions to competitive programming problems, often using greedy or dynamic programming techniques.
- **Testing**: Some problems include test scripts (e.g., test_simRot.py).
- **C++ Solutions**: Some linked list problems are also implemented in C++ for practice (translations mostly).

## How to Use

1. **Browse by Topic**: Navigate to the relevant folder for the problem/topic you are interested in.
2. **Run Solutions**: Each Python file is self-contained and can be run directly (some require input from stdin, sepcifically Yandex problems).
3. **Different Approaches**: Many problems include both brute-force (the first solution I usually do just to get going) and optimized solutions for comparison. 

## Example

To run a solution, simply execute the Python file. For example:

```bash
python leetcode/April/simpleRotate/simRot.py
```

Or, for a Yandex contest problem:

```bash
python yandex-algos/I_Greedy/A_Classrooms/computers4every1.py
```
*(Note: Some Yandex problems expect input from stdin.)*
