Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 
    4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 
    8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 
    13 has a frequency of 2.


Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment the first element three times 
and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
4 has a frequency of 3.

Input: nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
